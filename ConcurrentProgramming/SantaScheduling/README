Question 1:
I guarantee that only 3 elves will ask a question because my program has an
elf counter(ecount) and a semaphore(ElfCheck). ElfCheck has an initial value
of 3, so 3 processes can pass through it. Past the wait on ElfCheck, it
adds 1 to ecount and checks if it equals 3. If it does, then the three elves
can wake Santa. When Santa is finished helping the three elves, ecount gets
decreased by 3 and ElfCheck gets signaled 3 times to let in 3 more elves.

Question 2:
No elf will leave before their question is answered because of the semaphore
ElfQuestions which starts with the value 0. Any elf that gets past ElfCheck
will wait on ElfQuestions. ElfQuestions only gets signaled once Santa is done
answering the three elves' problems.

Question 3:
No other elves can cut in because of the semaphore ElfCheck, which only
allows 3 elves through to Santa and only gets signaled once Santa is done
answering those 3 elves' problems.

Question 4:
Santa only answers questions when he is not sleeping because once 3 elves
have questions, they signal Santa to wake up and Santa only goes back to
sleep from the Sleep function after he helps the elves.

Question 5:
Santa is wakened by the last reindeer because a counter(rcount) keeps 
track of how many reindeer have returned and Santa is only signaled when
rcount equals the total number of reindeer.

Question 6:
I make sure that Santa always helps reindeer first because when he is woken
up, Santa first checks if all the reindeer back and then checks if there are
three elves. This way, reindeer are helped before elves.

Question 7:
While Santa is attaching the sleigh, all reindeer have gone through a wait, so
all reindeer are waiting for Santa. Santa then signals every reindeer to the
next wait to wait for flying off. Then Santa signals all the reindeer to
go for vacation.

Question 8:
While Santa is delivering, elves will not ask questions because there is a
mutex(Mlock) on Santa's availability. Since Santa is delivering, the mutex
is locked and the elves are waiting for it to unlock. The mutex unlocks when
Santa releases his reindeer for vacation.
